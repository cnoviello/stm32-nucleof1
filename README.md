# Eclipse project templates for STM32Nucleo-F1
This repository contains basic templates for the STM32Nucleo-F1 developing board from ST. 

These projects are thought as companion examples to [my blog posts](http://www.carminenoviello.com/en/tag/stm32nucleo-en/) where I describe in depth how to use them. However they can be a good starting point to start programming your Nucleo board.

Templates were generated in Eclipse using [GNU ARM Eclipse](http://gnuarmeclipse.livius.net/blog/) by Liviu Ionescu. If you need to setup the whole Eclipse/GCC ARM tool-chain, you can follow [this series](http://www.carminenoviello.com/en/2014/12/28/setting-gcceclipse-toolchain-stm32nucleo-part-1/) made of three parts on my blog.

These templates are preconfigured to work with Nucleo-F103RB board.
